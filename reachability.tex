\section{Reachability analysis}

It is not difficult to translate an MMTs to a timed automaton \cite{AD94,BengtssonY03} that accepts the same timed words.
Through such a translation, verification and analysis tools for timed automata, such as Uppaal \cite{Uppaal4.0}
become available for MMTs.
MMTs are less expressive than timed automata. MMTs, for instance, do not contain time deadlocks or zeno loops that
may prevent time from progressing.

MMTs have infinitely (in fact even uncountably) many configurations and it is thus necessary to use symbolic representations
for reachability analysis. Given an untimed behavior $\beta$ we want to compute its effect on a set of valuations. 
If $\beta =X_0$ and $K \subseteq\Vals{X_0}$ then we define $\Post_{\beta}(K) = K$.
If $\beta = X_0 \xrightarrow{i_1/o_1, \rho_1} X_1$ and
$K \subseteq\Vals{X_0}$ then
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Post_{\beta}(K) & = & \{ \tvals'' \in\Vals{X_1} \mid \exists \tvals \in K \exists d >0 \exists \tvals' \in\Vals{X_0} :
 \tvals \xrightarrow{d} \tvals' \xrightarrow{i_1/o_1, \rho_1} \tvals'' \}.
\end{eqnarray*}
The definition of $\Post_{\beta}(K)$ is extended inductively to arbitrary $\beta$ by 
$\Post_{\gamma \cdot \gamma'}(K) = \Post_{\gamma'} (\Post_{\gamma}(K))$, where $\gamma \cdot \gamma'$ is the decomposition of
$\beta$ into an untimed behavior $\gamma$ of length one and an untimed behavior $\gamma'$.
We write $\Post_{\beta}$ as abbreviation for $\Post_{\beta}(\Vals{\Head{\beta}})$.

For any untimed behavior $\beta$, $\Post_{\beta}$ can be symbolically represented and computed using a Difference Bound Matrices (DBMs)
 \cite{Di89},  as the transition relations $\xrightarrow{d}$ and $\xrightarrow{i_1/o_1, \rho_1}$ can be decomposed 
into elementary operations on DBMs such as reset, conjunction, and delay successors \cite{BengtssonY03}.
%
It is easy to see that an untimed behavior $\beta$ is feasible iff $\Post_{\beta} \neq \emptyset$.
Since emptiness of DBMs is decidable, this allows us to compute whether or not $\beta$ is feasible.

The next technical lemma's are needed further on:

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma: feasibility concatenation}
Suppose $\beta, \beta'$ are untimed behaviors with
% $\Last{\beta} = \Last{\beta'} = X_1$ and 
$\Post_{\beta} = Post_{\beta'}$. Let $\gamma$ be any untimed behavior.
Then $\beta \cdot \gamma$ is feasible iff $\beta' \cdot \gamma$ is feasible.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma finitely many zones}
The set
$\{ \Post_{\beta} \mid \beta \mbox{ is a feasible untimed behavior of } \M \}$ is finite.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
All the sets $\Post_{\beta}$ can be represented using DBMs. Since an MMT only has a finite number of timers that can only be set to a finite number of integer values. Since in an MMT the values of timers can only decrease, only finitely many numbers may
appear in the DBM's that represent the sets $\Post_{\beta}$. Thus all the sets $\Post_{\beta}$ can be represented by a finite
collection of DBMs.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Suppose $\beta$ is a feasible untimed behavior and $Y \xrightarrow{i/o, \rho} Y'$ is an untimed behavior,
with $Y = \Last{\beta}$ and $i \in I$.
Then $\beta \xrightarrow{i/o, \rho} Y'$ is a feasible untimed behavior.
\end{lemma}

Let $\beta$ be a feasible untimed behavior and let $x \in X$ be a timer. Then we say that $x$ is \emph{expirable} after $\beta$
if there exists a valuation in $\Post_{\beta}$ in which $x$ is minimal.

\begin{lemma}
Suppose $\beta$ is a feasible untimed behavior and $Y \xrightarrow{\toevent{x}/o, \rho} Y'$ is an untimed behavior 
with $Y = \Last{\beta}$.
Then $x$ is expirable after $\beta$ iff $\beta \xrightarrow{\toevent{x}/o, \rho} Y'$ is feasible.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
\label{not untimed}
Suppose $\M$ and $\N$ are MMTs with $\M \not\approx_{\mathit{untimed}} \N$.
Then there exists a feasible untimed behavior $\beta$ of $\M$ that is not isomorphic to any feasible untimed
behavior of $\N$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
\label{not timed}
Suppose $\M$ and $\N$ are MMTs with $\M \not\approx_{\mathit{timed}} \N$.
Then there exists a transparent timed word $w$ of $\M$ that is not a timed word of $\N$.
\end{lemma}
