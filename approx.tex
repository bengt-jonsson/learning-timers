\section{A Myhill Nerode Theorem for MMTs}
\label{sec:nerode}
\label{sec:bj-nerode}

We will now exploit the equivalence between timed and untimed semantics
(Theorems~\ref{untimedimpliestimed} and~\ref{timedimpliesuntimed}).
In this section, we develop a Nerode congruence for building MMTs
from their sets of untimed
We thereafter, in Section~\ref{sec:approx} present an approximation of this
Nerode equivalence, tobe used as a basis for the learning algorithm in
Section~\ref{sec:learning}.

  A Nerode congruence allows to build automata from their languages. For MMTs,
  these languages are their sets of untimed behaviors, in canonical form.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:timer language}
A \emph{timer language} over $I$ and $O$ is a nonempty set 
$S$ of feasible untimed behaviors in canonical form over $I$ and $O$ that satisfies the following five properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\emph{no initial timers}: $\beta \in S \Rightarrow \Head{\beta} = \emptyset$,
\item
\emph{prefix closed}: $\beta \cdot \gamma \in S \Rightarrow \beta \in S$,
\item
\emph{behavior deterministic}:
$\beta \xrightarrow{i/o_1/\rho_1} X_1 \in S \wedge \beta \xrightarrow{i/o_2/\rho_2} X_2 \in S \Rightarrow o_1 = o_2 \wedge \rho_1 = \rho_2 \wedge X_1 = X_2$,
\item
\emph{input complete}:
$\beta \in S \wedge i \in I \Rightarrow \exists o, \rho, Y : \beta \xrightarrow{i/o/\rho} Y \in S$,
and
\item
\emph{timeout complete}:
$\beta \in S \wedge x \mbox{ expirable after } \beta \Rightarrow
\exists o, \rho, Y: \beta \xrightarrow{\toevent{x}/o/\rho} Y \in S$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

During learning of an MMT, the Learner does not ``see'' all the timers
in the sets of timers of an untimed behavior, only those that have
been observed to expire at some later point. 
Recall that an untimed behavior is {\em lean} if it is canonical and
includes only timers that expire during the behavior.
Let $\lean{\beta}$ be the lean behavior obtained from a canonical
behavior $\beta$.
Since the sequence of timer sets in a lean behavior is
uniquely determined by the labels on its transition, we can
denote a lean behavior simply by the sequence
$\utlabel{i_1}{o_1}{\rho_1} \cdots \utlabel{i_n}{o_n}{\rho_n}$ of its labels.
If some $\rho_j$ is empty, we often omit it. In particular,
the last assignment of any lean behavior is always empty.

Define a {\em lean timer language} to be the set of lean behaviors derived from
a timer language. Given a lean timer language $S$, we can obtain a corresponding
timer language as follows. For a lean behavior, 
let $\getmemorable{S}{\beta}$ be the set of timers $x_i$ in
$x_1 , \ldots x_{|\beta|}$ whose corresponding timeout event
(of form $\toevent{x_i}$) occurs (as an input) in som continuation $\beta'$
of $\beta$ in $S$.
Let $\getassignment{S}{\beta}$ map each timer $x_i$ in
$\getmemorable{S}{\beta}$ to the unique positive integer to which it
is assigned in that extension.
It is easy to transform a lean untimed language into a corresponding untimed one:
simply replace each lean behavior by the untimed behavior obtained by
letting $\getmemorable{S}{\beta}$ be the set of timers after $\beta$,
and assigning each occurring timer to 
$\getassignment{S}{\beta}(x_i)$ in the $i$th transition.
In the following, when referring to ``timer languages'', we will always
mean ``lean timer languages''.

The basis for a Nerode equivalence is to define residual languages.
Intuitively, we would like to say that $\beta$ and $\beta'$ are equivalent if
roughly
``$\beta \cdot \gamma \in S \iff \beta' \cdot \gamma \in S$''. However, we must
be careful with the names of timers that expire and/or are assigned in $\gamma$.
We will therefore introduce conventions for naming timers in suffixes, in
analogy with the naming in canonical behaviors.

So, extend the set of timers by the set $Y = \set{y_1,y_2,\ldots}$ of
{\em suffix timers}, which is disjoint from $X$.
Let $\toeventsof{Y}$ be the set of timeout events of form
$\toevent{y_i}$ for $y_i \in Y$, and let
$\extextinputs$ be $I \cup \toevents \cup \toeventsof{Y}$.
Define a {\em lean suffix behavior} ({\em lean suffix} for short)
to be a sequence
$\utlabel{i_1}{o_1}{\rho_1} \cdots \utlabel{i_m}{o_m}{\rho_m}$ of input/output/assignment triples,
in which each $i_j$ is in $\extextinputs$, 
each $\rho_j$ may assign only to the timer $y_j$,
each timeout event occurs at most once,
and all timers that are assigned in $Y$ expire in some transition
after their assignment.

For integer $k \geq 0$, let $\suffmap{k}$ be the injective mapping on
$Y$ which maps each $y_j$ to $x_{j+k}$.  We apply mappings of form
$\suffmap{k}$ to lean suffix behaviors in the natural way.

We can now define residual langues. For a (lean) timer language $S$ and lean
behavior $\beta \in S$, let
$\suffixbehs{S}{\beta}$ be the set of lean suffixes $\gamma$ such that
there is a canonical behavior $\beta'$ with $\beta \sqsubseteq \beta'$ such that
$\beta'\cdot\suffmap{|\beta|}(\gamma) \in S$.
Then $\getmemorable{S}{\beta}$ is the set of timers $x_i$ in
$x_1 , \ldots x_{|\beta|}$ whose corresponding timeout event
(of form $\toevent{x_i}$) occurs (as an input) in some suffix $\hat{\gamma}$ in
$\suffixbehs{S}{\beta}$, and
$\getassignment{S}{\beta}$ maps each timer $x_i$ in
$\getmemorable{S}{\beta}$ to the unique positive integer to which it
is assigned in the corresponding
lean behavior $\beta'\cdot\suffmap{|\beta|}(\hat{\gamma})$
in $S$.

We can now define the Nerode equivalence.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:bj-nerode}
Let $S$ be a (lean) timer language with $\beta,\beta'\in S$,
and let $f : \getmemorable{S}{\beta} \to \getmemorable{S}{\beta'}$
be a bijection
from $\getmemorable{S}{\beta}$ to $\getmemorable{S}{\beta'}$.
Then $\beta$ and $\beta'$ are \emph{equivalent} under $f$, written
$\beta \equiv_{S}^f \beta'$ iff
\[
\gamma \in \suffixbehs{S}{\beta}
\qquad \mbox{iff} \qquad
f(\gamma) \in \suffixbehs{S}{\beta'}
\]
\end{definition}
Intuitively, $\beta \equiv_{S}^f \beta'$ means that $\beta$ and $\beta'$
allow the same suffixes, after renaming
timers assigned in $\beta$ by $f$.
We write $\beta \equiv_{S} \beta'$ to denote that
$\beta \equiv_{S}^f \beta'$ for some
$f : \getmemorable{S}{\beta} \to \getmemorable{S}{\beta'}$.

\paragraph{Example} Let $S$ contain the lean behaviors
\[
\utlabel{i_1}{o_1}{\set{x_1:=5}} \cdot \simpleutlabel{\toevent{x_1}}{o_3}
\mbox{ and }
\simpleutlabel{i_1}{o_1} \cdot \utlabel{i_2}{o_2}{\set{x_2:=4}} \cdot \simpleutlabel{\toevent{x_2}}{o_3}
\]
Let $\beta_1 = \simpleutlabel{i_1}{o_1}$ and
$\beta_2 = \simpleutlabel{i_1}{o_1} \cdot \simpleutlabel{i_2}{o_2}$.
Then $\suffixbehs{S}{\beta_1}$ contains the suffix
$\gamma_1 = \simpleutlabel{\toevent{x_1}}{o_3}$ and
$\suffixbehs{S}{\beta_2}$ contains the suffix
$\gamma_2 = \simpleutlabel{\toevent{x_2}}{o_3}$.
%% Then $\simpleutlabel{\toevent{x_1}}{o_1}$ and
%% $\utlabel{\toevent{x_1}}{o_1}{\set{y_1:= 3}} \cdot \simpleutlabel{\toevent{y_1}}{o_2}$.
It is then possible that
$\beta_1 \equiv_S^f \beta_2$, where $f$ maps $x_1$ to $x_2$ (whether
$\beta_1 \equiv_S^f \beta_2$ actually holds depends, of course, on which other
behaviors are in $S$.

%% \(
%% q_0 \simpleuttrans{i_1}{o_1} q_0 \uttrans{i_2}{o_2}{x_1:= 5} q_2
%% \),
%% and that from $q_2$ it can perform
%% \(
%% q_2 \simpleuttrans{\toevent{x_1}}{o_3} q_3
%% \).
%% The canonical untimed behaviors corresponding to the first two
%% untimed runs are
%% \(
%% \emptyset \uttrans{i_1}{o_1}{x_1:= 5} \set{x_1}
%% \)
%% and
%% \(
%% \emptyset \uttrans{i_1}{o_1}{} \emptyset \uttrans{i_2}{o_2}{x_2:= 5} \set{x_2}
%% \).
%% In order to let these two behaviors be equivalent we must discover that
%% timer $x_1$ can expire after the first one, and that
%% timer $x_2$ can expire after the second one. Since these two timers
%% have the same rules, the set $V$ of suffixes must
%% include the effects of the timeout events of form $\toevent{x_i}$ for any
%% timer $x_i$ that is assigned in a prefix, otherwise we
%% may fail to overapproximate the Nerode equivalence of Definition~\ref{def:nerode}.


\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:bj-nerode}
Let $S$ be a lean timer language.
Then there exists an MMT with lean timer language $S$ iff 
$\equiv_S$ has finitely many equivalence classes (finite index).

\section{Approximating the Nerode Equivalence}
\label{sec:approx}

For the learning algorithm, we must define an overapproximation
of the Nerode equivalence on untimed behaviors
defined in Definition~\ref{def:bj-nerode}. This
approximated equivalence can be inferred using a finite set of membership
queries, and therefore be used as a basis for a learning algorithm,
analogously to the use of an approximated Nerode equivalence in
$L^*$~\cite{Ang87}.

It seems natural to parameterize such an equivalence by
a finite set $V$ of untimed input words (hereafter often
called {\em input suffixes}), restricting Definition~\ref{def:bj-nerode}
to suffixes $\gamma$ and $f(\gamma)$ with
$\untimedinputword(\gamma)$ and $\untimedinputword(f(\gamma))$ in $V$.
Already here, we see that it is convenient to 
let $V$ be closed under permutations
on timers in $X$, so that $\untimedinputword(\gamma) \in V$ iff
$\untimedinputword(f(\gamma)) \in V$.
Let us call such a set {\em adequate}.
%% and includes all input suffixes of length one.
For an adequate set $V$ of input suffixes, and a lean behavior $\beta$,
let $\apprsuffixbehs{S}{\beta}{V}$ be the set of suffixes $\gamma$
with $\untimedinputword(\gamma) \in V$.
Let $\apprgetmemorable{S}{\beta}{V}$ be the set of timers $x_i$ in
$x_1 , \ldots x_{|\beta|}$ whose corresponding timeout event
(of form $\toevent{x_i}$) occurs (as an input) in some suffix in
$\apprsuffixbehs{S}{\beta}{V}$.
Let $\apprgetassignment{S}{\beta}{V}$ map each timer $x_i$ in
$\apprgetmemorable{S}{\beta}{V}$ to the unique positive integer to which it
is assigned in the $i$th transition of $\beta$.

%% \todobj{Maybe we should point out that two prefixes $\beta$ and $\beta'$
%%   can be equivalent even if they assign corresponding timers to different
%%   values. However, timers assigned in corresponding suffixes must
%%   be assigned the same values.}

%% Let us introduce the {\em generic timeout event} $\toevent{p}$, where $p$w can
%% be regarded as a formal parameter,
%% which can be instantiated to an arbitrary timout event.
%% Let $(I \cup \set{\toevent{p}})^*$ be the set of
%% {\em generic untimed input words}.
%% An {\em instance} of a generic untimed input word is an untimed input
%% word obtained by replacing each generic timeout event
%% $\toevent{p}$ by a concrete timeout event.
%% For a set $V$ of generic untimed input words, let $\instancesof{V}$ be the
%% set of instances of words in $V$. For a canonical untimed
%% behavior $\beta$, let $\apprsuffixbehs{S}{\beta}{V}$ be the set of untimed behaviors
%% $\gamma$ with $\untimedinputword(\gamma) \in \instancesof{V}$ such that
%% $\beta\cdot\gamma$ is a canonical untimed behavior in $S$. Let
%% $\apprgetmemorable{S}{\beta}{V}$ be the set of timers $x_i$ in
%% $x_1 , \ldots x_{|\beta|}$ whose corresponding timeout event
%% (of form $\toevent{x_i}$) occurs (as an input) in some untimed behavior in
%% $\apprsuffixbehs{S}{\beta}{V}$.
%% Let $\apprgetassignment{S}{\beta}{V}$ map each timer $x_i$ in
%% $\apprgetmemorable{S}{\beta}{V}$ to the unique positive integer to which it
%% is assigned in the $i$th transition of that behavior.


%% Let $\suffbij{\beta}{\beta'}$ be the partial injective mapping
%% on timers that maps each
%% timer $x_i$ with $i > |\beta|$ to $x_{i + |\beta'| - |\beta|}$.
%% Intuitively, $\suffbij{\beta}{\beta'}$ maps a timer that is assigned 
%% in a transition of $\gamma$, where $\gamma$ is a suffix of the canonical
%% untimed behavior $\beta \cdot \gamma$, to the corresponding timer of
%% the canonical untimed behavior $\beta'\cdot\gamma$.
%% For two partial mappings $f$, $g$ on $X$, we let $f \sqcup g$ be their
%% union. \todobj{Does this need to be further clarified?}

%% \todobj{An illustrating example would help the reader here}

\todobj{We really need a few examples here}

We can now define the approximated Nerode equivalence, which is parameterized
on an adequate set of lean input suffixes.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:approx-nerode}
Let $S$ be a timer language \todobj{Define this},
let $\beta$ and $\beta'$ be canonical untimed behaviors in $S$,
and let  $V$ be an adequate set of lean input suffixes.
Let $f : \apprgetmemorable{S}{\beta}{V} \to \apprgetmemorable{S}{\beta'}{V}$
be a bijection
from $\apprgetmemorable{S}{\beta}{V}$ to $\apprgetmemorable{S}{\beta'}{V}$.
Then $\beta$ and $\beta'$ are \emph{equivalent wrp $V$} under $f$, written
$\beta \equiv_{S,V}^f \beta'$ iff
\[
\gamma \in \apprsuffixbehs{S}{\beta}{V}
\qquad \mbox{iff} \qquad
f(\gamma) \in \apprsuffixbehs{S}{\beta'}{V}
\]
\end{definition}
Intuitively, $\beta \equiv_{S,V}^f \beta'$ means that $\beta$ and $\beta'$
allow the same suffixes with inputs in $V$, after renaming
timers assigned in $\beta$ by $f$.
We write $\beta \equiv_{S,V} \beta'$ to denote that
$\beta \equiv_{S,V}^f \beta'$ for some
$f : \apprgetmemorable{S}{\beta}{V} \to \apprgetmemorable{S}{\beta'}{V}$.


\todobj{Let us add theorems. It should be obvious that the approximated one
  approximates the full one, and that it converges.}
