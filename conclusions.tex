\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Everybody is using timed automata in which clocks run forward. It feels like driving on the wrong side of the road to study MMTs. But it is fun!
\item
MMTs constitute interesting modelling framework for which tractable learning algorithm exists.
\item
Future work: study various forms of timing uncertainty.
\item
Get rid of timer liveness assumption.
\item
Implement and apply to practical case studies.
\end{itemize}
